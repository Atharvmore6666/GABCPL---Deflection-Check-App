# GABCPL---Deflection-Check-App
GABCPL is a Streamlit web application designed to help civil and structural engineers check the deflection of ETABS projects. The app automates the process of reading an ETABS XML output file, calculating deflection limits based on industry standards, and presenting a clear, color-coded report.
